              Our Mission at Plate of Africa is to foster community through the
              flavors of Africa using a plant-based lens. We hope that through
              the power of plant-based cooking, we can create a community that
              shares the same values of community. Every dish that we serve to
              our community is put together using love, source locally, and put
              together with sustainability in mind. We hope that through using
              plant-based cooking methods, we can create dishes that not only
              nourish the body, but also the soul.

                What sets Plate of Africa apart from other restaurants is the
                diversity we bring to the table. The dishes served here are not
                from just one area or one region, but the entire continent.
                Whether it be the richness from West Africa stews, to the
                complex spices used in East African cuisine, our dishes
                encompass all different types of flavors, textures, and cooking
                methods. Our chef’s are committed to serving only the most
                authentic cuisine, using only the freshest ingredients. The
                recipes that make our dishes are recipes that have been used for
                generations, perfected and refined by each generation before.

                different is the community it creates through its food. Every
                dish is not just food, but a gateway towards a whole different
                world that you may not be familiar with. It is a way to explore
                different cultures, and create connections through the shared
                values of food. Our diversity is not simply limited to our menu,
                but extends to the environment we create.

              When we decided to create Plate of Africa, we envisioned it as
              more than just a restaurant. Plate of Africa is a place where
              people of all cultures, and all backgrounds, can come together
              under the shared passion for culinary excellence. Plate of Africa
              was created simply by 3 men, each with a passion for cooking.
              Whether it be a medium rare steak, or a perfectly baked focaccia,
              these men were absolutely enthralled with the complexity of food.
              They found that food was not just about flavor or texture, but
              about the people you share the food with.

          <div class="second-paragraph">
            <div class="this-passion-led">
              This passion led to these men deciding to pursue a culinary
              education at Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts in Austin,
              Texas, earning a diploma in Plant-Based Culinary Arts.they began
              to  After graduating, they began to work as a chefs at La Lumiere
              Etoilee, their first professional career. However, despite their
              job stability, and skills, they felt a sense of emptiness. The
              food that they cooked always seemed to be missing something
              essential. As they traveled, they realized the essential thing
              they were missing was that of great simplicity: Community.

          <div class="second-paragraph">
            <div class="this-passion-led">
              This realization drove them to create Plate of Africa, a place
              where people could combine culinary excellence and community can
              combine to bring an amazing experience. They decided to choose to
              specialize in African cuisine as it was the food they had been
              eating all of their lives. Specifically, they decided that a vegan
              restaurant would be the best, due to its many environmental and
              health benefits. This was the beginning of an idea that created
              the Plate of Africa you see today.
