                        When we decided to create Plate of Africa, we envisioned it as more than just a restaurant. Plate of Africa is a place where people of all cultures, and all backgrounds, can come together under the shared passion for culinary excellence. Plate of Africa was created simply by 3 men, each with a passion for cooking. Whether it be a medium rare steak, or a perfectly baked focaccia, these men were absolutely enthralled with the complexity of food. They found that food was not just about flavor or texture, but about the people you share the food with.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This passion led to these men deciding to pursue a culinary education at Auguste Escoffier School of Culinary Arts in Austin, Texas, earning a diploma in Plant-Based Culinary Arts. After graduating, they began to work as chefs at La Lumiere Etoilee, their first professional career. However, despite their job stability, and skills, they felt a sense of emptiness. The food that they cooked always seemed to be missing something essential. As they traveled, they realized the essential thing they were missing was that of great simplicity: Community.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This realization drove them to create Plate of Africa, a place where people could combine culinary excellence and community can combine to bring an amazing experience. They decided to choose to specialize in African cuisine as it was the food they had been eating all of their lives. Specifically, they decided that a vegan restaurant would be the best, due to its many environmental and health benefits. This was the beginning of an idea that created the Plate of Africa you see today.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        As Plate of Africa begins to move towards the future, we will continue to uphold the core values that founded us: that of culinary excellence, passion, and most of all, community. We are beyond thrilled to share with you our passion, and to create lasting memories one plate at a time.

                        What sets Plate of Africa apart from other restaurants is the diversity we bring to the table. The dishes served here are not from just one area or one region, but the entire continent. Whether it be the richness from West Africa stews, to the complex spices used in East African cuisine, our dishes encompass all different types of flavors, textures, and cooking methods. Our chef's are committed to serving only the most authentic cuisine, using only the freshest ingredients. The recipes that make our dishes are recipes that have been used for generations, perfected and refined by each generation before.                     </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        However, the thing that truly makes the Plate of Africa different is the community it creates through its food. Every dish is not just food, but a gateway towards a whole different world that you may not be familiar with. It is a way to explore different cultures, and create connections through the shared values of food. Our diversity is not simply limited to our menu, but extends to the environment we create.
